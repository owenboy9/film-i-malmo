        Volunteering at Film i Malmö’s screenings at Hypnos Theatre is not a chore. < br />
        Rather, it is meant to be an empowering kind of agency you take in your own hands. < br />
        You choose how much and how often you want to be there, and co-create the wonders of shared cinematic experience.</p>
