      <h1>About Film i Malmö</h1>

      <p>
        Founded in December 2018 as a non-profit organization with the broad mission to support local film culture, < br />
        Film i Malmö rents the venue, Hypnos Theatre, to build a vibrant social atmosphere where everyone< br />
        – casual movie-goers, filmmakers and devout cinephiles, alike – feel most welcome. </p>

      <p>
        Thanks to a few highly-devoted volunteers, responsible for programming, promotion and hosting, < br />
        Film i Malmö has screened a diverse selection of over 400 films.< br />
        We are grateful to have the opportunity to present films  in accordance with our agreement with < br />
        SwedishFilm and on special occasions with support from Malmö Stad. </p>

        <p>
